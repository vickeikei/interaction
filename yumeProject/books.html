                <p id="tpisb"><em>This Place is Still Beautiful</em> by Xixi Tian <br>
                    <br>
                    This book made my heart ache, but at the same time, filled the emptiness and hugged the pains away. Tian writes so gorgeously, capturing all the feelings that I've always wanted to express but couldn't find the words to. The two perspectives of the sisters are vastly different, and you can easily tell that they have distinct voices, and I thought that part was very well done. I think that all of us have both Annalie and Margaret inside of us, and I really reflected on that while reading the book. The story just paints the complexities of racism, family, sisterhood, identity, and choice so well. Just giving it five stars is not enough. </p>
                <p id="silence"><em>The Silence that Binds Us</em> by Joanna Ho <br>
                    <br>
                    A gorgeously written book filled with uplifting and heartbreaking stories that calls us to start listening to the stories of all the underrepresented communities around us. In silence, we can hear these voices clearer and give our love and support to them. But we must also be careful to not be strangled and drown in this silence. My tears were falling from beginning to end, staining these pages and serving as reminders to open my heart. </p>
                <p id="taste"> <em>A Taste for Love</em> by Jennifer Yen <br>
                    <br>
                    One of my favorite YA romances that I’ve read and re-read countless times. Centered around a baking competition where Liza’s mom has turned it into a matchmaking competition and filled with dim sum, baking, matchmaking, and boba, this book will have you swooning from the cute interactions of the main couple and the love of the other characters. </p>
                <p id="yolk"> <em> Yolk</em> by Mary H.K. Choi<br>
                    <br>
                    I adore any book that centers around sisters and their complicated relationship built on love. Two estranged sisters, Jayne and June, are forced together to fight cancer. Can they put their differences aside especially when it matters most? <em>Yolk</em> is a thought provoking and raw masterpiece. </p>
                <p id="mech"> <em>My Mechanical Romance</em> by Alexene Farol Follmuth <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>My Mechanical Romance</em> is an “enemies to academic colleagues to lovers” (quoting Jamie) so of course it’s going to be amazing! The description and the imagery in this book is just perfect, like it really engages you in the story. But I also just really love this story about how Bel doesn’t quite know what she wants to do in her life and that’s perfectly okay. Plans change, and they keep changing and everything will work out in the end. The character growth in this book is very inspirational, and it spoke to me at just the right moment in my life. </p>
                <p id="circling"> <em>Circling Back to You</em> by Julie Tieu <br>
                    <br>
                    I  really liked this book! It was sweet and witty, and the characters all had their own individuality which made me so invested in their stories. Their families were also so different, which made me love every single character even more.
                    <em> Circling Back to You</em> is the absolute perfect best friends to lovers office rom-com that will satisfy your sweet-tooth cravings and keep you wanting more!</p>
                <p id="tvd"> <em>These Violent Delights</em> by Chloe Gong <br>
                    <br>
                    Out of all my favorite books, <em>These Violent Delights</em> is definitely crowned at the top. I mean what can be better than a Romeo and Juliet retelling set in 1920s Shanghai? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Gong captures readers right into the world with her dazzling writing and multidimensional characters. This novel is created with the perfect amount of mystery, history, angst, and romance, existing as the perfect next read for any enemies-to-lovers enthusiast.</p>
                <p id="pho"> <em>A Pho Love Story</em> by Loan Le<br>
                    <br>
                    Bao and Linh’s families own competing pho restaurants, with their feud dating long before Bao and Linh were born. Bao and Linh complement each other so well. It’s a true balance for any good relationship and we see that here. Most of all, this book captures the connection and importance of family while making you drool for Vietnamese food. </p>
                <p id="tatb"> <em>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</em> by Jenny Han <br>
                    <br>
                    The book that started my love for Asian American protagonists and drove me to question the lack of representation in media. I can write a whole love letter to this book and the trilogy, but that would not fit on this page. I absolutely adore Lara Jean and her love for love. It’s a coming of age story that feels so relatable and stabs right into your heart, giving you the courage to be your own main character. P.S. the book is so much better than the movies...</p>
                <p id="girl"> <em>The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea</em> by Axie Oh <br>
                    <br>
                    A story about love, family, courage, and hope filled with many stories within it. Oh did a fantastic job at retelling the story of Shim Cheong with the descriptive imagery woven perfectly into the words of narration. My heart is full, though there is still a part that still wants more because it it just that good. I loved every single character in this book. I haven’t cried over a book in a while, but while reading this, tears were just spilling out of my eyes.</p>
                <p id="charmed"> <em> The Charmed List</em> by Julie Abe <br>
                    <br>
                    A magical roadtrip with two former friends turned 'enemies' is bound to have some sparks fly right?<em> The Charmed List</em> follows Ellie Kobata and Jack Yasuda on their road trip to a magical convention. A summer story of friendship, love, growing-up, and of course, magic! Julie Abe wonderfully creates a whole new magical world while blending it smoothly into our contemporary world, full of all the good things that brighten up our lives, that keeps readers hooked and wishing for their own pair of spectacles to see the beautiful raw magic dust floating through space!</p>
                <p id="cdwy"> <em> Counting Down with You</em> by Tashie Bhuiyan<br>
                    <br>
                    Warning: <em>Counting Down with You</em>  will absolutely wreck your expectations for love and raise your standards even higher. Karina’s story of finding courage and strength will inspire you to chase your dreams despite the expectations set by immigrant families. We all need our very own Dadu to tell us that she is proud of us. Bhuiyan is unafraid to tackle harsh conversations about mental health which makes this book even more raw and inspiring. </p>
